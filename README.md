# Grading Framework

## How to use it 
### Start a session
1. Open a terminal in the folder 
2. `python3 -m http.server`
3. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser
### Save your work
Since Firefoy does not support the File System Access API, for now the save button just triggers a download of a json file with all the input values. 
You can then reload that file with the load button.
